# Introduction to FastAPI

## What is FastAPI?
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.

## When use FastAPI?
FastAPI is perfect when you need to:
1. Build REST APIs quickly (CRUD apps, microservices)
2. Deploy machine learning models as APIs
3. Handle high-performance or async tasks
4. Auto-generate documentation for public or internal APIs
5. Create services that need validation and type checking

## üöÄ Why FastAPI?

- **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go.
- **Easy to use**: Designed to be easy to use and learn.
- **Automatic Docs**: Comes with built-in interactive API docs using Swagger and ReDoc.
- **Pythonic**: Built using modern Python features like type hints.
